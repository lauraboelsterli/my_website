      A recent hobby of mine that I recently picked up is GIS. I did an intenrship at a reinsurance company, Hannover
      Re, this summer where I was exposed to the impact and uses of GIS in catastrophe modeling and management. I wanted to see 
      how else it could take me further, which is why I'm auditing a GIS course at Northeastern right led by an Enviornmental Science 
      professor. This is introducing me to a whole new application of GIS on another industry, and I've been enjoying the work we've done and 
      working on my final project, which will be about hurricanes and the socioeconomic vulnerable populations across counties across Florida.
      I plan on keeping you guys updated on my final project phases for my GIS course on this page, so stay tuned...

      I mainly work with GIS on ArcGIS, though have been using it with geopandandas and plotly geo as well for personal projects. I am working 
      on a geospatial mapping of earthquake occurences around the world. I'm analyzing multiple features from the dataset such as earthquake 
      magnitude, total deaths, total economic impact ($s in damage), and potentially more. We might bring in more datasets to add more complexity
      to the overall analysis, such as GDP data â€” before and after the earthquake events. Another thing we are considering, 
      is removing smaller occurence earthquakes from the dataset, since the dataset's quality isn't great and has a null values in almsot very column,
      deciding a threshold on which earthquakes to keep, could improve overall data quality, as more information is recorded in every column for 
      major earthquakes in comparison to other less significant ones. To see the progress of this project, also stay tuned, I will post more..

        <li>this assignment had shape files with wrong projections, which is where I learned about 
            Geographic Coordinate Systems and Projected Coordinate Systems and made sure the source of 
            each file was appropriately mapped to the units that were given</li>
